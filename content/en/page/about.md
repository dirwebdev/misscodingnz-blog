# About Davey

Hi there! My name is Davey and I am a tech enthusiast and software developer. I have been working in the tech industry for the past 5 years and am always on the lookout for new challenges and ways to improve my skills.

I am a big fan of open source software and enjoy contributing to various projects in my free time. I am also an avid learner and am constantly reading about new technologies and approaches to problem-solving.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me gaming or tinkering with some new piece of hardware. I'm a huge fan of retro computing and have a small collection of vintage computers that I enjoy restoring and using.

I'm excited to connect with other like-minded individuals and am always open to collaboration and new ideas. Feel free to reach out to me via email or social media. Thanks for stopping by!
